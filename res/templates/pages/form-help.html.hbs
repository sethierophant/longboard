        <h1>Making a New Thread or Post</h1>
        <h2>Options</h2>
        <p>
            There's a lot of different options available to you when creating a
            new thread or post. Here's what they do.
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Subject</dt>
            <dd>
                The main topic of your thread.
            </dd>
            <dt>Name</dt>
            <dd>
                The name you're posting under. This doesn't have to be your
                real name, and in most cases, this shouldn't be your real name.
                If you don't choose a name, one will be chosen for you.
            </dd>
            <dt>Contact</dt>
            <dd>
                A way for other posters to contact you in private, such as an
                e-mail address, IRC nick, ...
            </dd>
            <dt>Identity</dt>
            <dd>
                A secret identity that will be cryptographically hashed and
                displayed next to the name you choose. This is a way of proving
                to other users that you are who you say you are. Any other
                poster can use a name that you also use, but this identity is a
                secret only known to you.
            </dd>
            <dd>
                Only use this field if it's really necessary, most of the posts
                made on an anonymous imageboard should be anonymous.
            </dd>
            <dt>File</dt>
            <dd>
                An image or file to attach to your post.
            </dd>
            <dd>
                This file must be under the site file size limit, which is
                {{file_size_limit}} bytes.
            </dd>
            <dd>
                This file must also be one of the allowed file types, which are:
                <ul>
                    {{#each allow_file_types}}
                        <li>{{this}}</li>
                    {{/each}}
                </ul>
            </dd>
            <dt>Spoiler</dt>
            <dd>
                Whether or not the image attached to your post should be hidden
                by default. This option should be checked if your image is
                lewd, violent, or otherwise NSFW. 
            </dd>
            <dd>
                In general, assume that everyone else using this site is in a
                caf√© or public library. Err on the side of caution.
            </dd>
            <dt>Password</dt>
            <dd>
                A password for post deletion. If at some point in the future
                you want to delete this post (or delete the file attached to
                the post), you'll need this password.
            </dd>
            <dt>No Bump</dt>
            <dd>
                Don't bump the thread you're replying to. The default behavior
                is to bump a thread whenever it is replied to, this option
                disables that behavior.
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <h2>Formatting</h2>
        <p>
            Any post you make is split up into <em>blocks</em>. A block can be
            a header:
        </p>
        <section class="example">
            <section class="example-input">
                <p><code># Noots general<br>Post stacks, post research, rant about what works / what doesn't work / why people who use noots are idiots</code></p>
            </section>
            <section class="example-output body-contents">
                <h3>Noots general</h3>
                <p>Post stacks, post research, rant about what works / what doesn't work / why people who use noots are idiots</p>
            </section>
        </section>
        <p>A quote:</p>
        <section class="example">
            <section class="example-input">
                <p><code>&gt;I used the strongest, fastest-hitting form of meth there is, and wow, it ruined my life!</code></p>
            </section>
            <section class="example-output body-contents">
                <blockquote><p>I used the strongest, fastest-hitting form of meth there is, and wow, it ruined my life!</p></blockquote>
            </section>
        </section>
        <p>
            A block of code (if you don't specify a language, highlight.js
            will try to guess what the language is):
        </p>
        <section class="example">
            <section class="example-input">
                <pre><code>``` C
/* between values */
if(lo &lt;= x &amp;&amp; x &lt;= hi) { ... }

/* not between */
if(x &lt; lo &amp;&amp; hi &lt; x) { ... } 
```</code></pre>
            </section>
            <section class="example-output body-contents">
                <pre class="blockcode"><code class="language-C">/* between values */
if(lo &lt;= x &amp;&amp; x &lt;= hi) { ... }

/* not between */
if(x &lt; lo &amp;&amp; hi &lt; x) { ... }</code></pre>
            </section>
        </section>
        <p>Or just normal text:</p>
        <section class="example">
            <section class="example-input">
                <p><code>Yes, inhaling burnt matter is bad for your lungs, you needed an expert opinion to realize this?</code></p>
            </section>
            <section class="example-output body-contents">
                <p>Yes, inhaling burnt matter is bad for your lungs, you needed an expert opinion to realize this?</p>
            </section>
        </section>
        <p>
            Additionally, within header, quote, and normal text blocks there are
            some formatting options you can use.
        </p>
        <p>You can bold text:</p>
        <section class="example">
            <section class="example-input">
                <p><code>I didn't put anything in your mouth, Lain. Read my posts again if you think I did. I never made a claim about what you believe, because **I didn't understand it**.</code></p>
            </section>
            <section class="example-output body-contents">
                <p>I didn't put anything in your mouth, Lain. Read my posts again if you think I did. I never made a claim about what you believe, because <strong>I didn't understand it</strong>.</p>
            </section>
        </section>
        <p>You can italicize text:</p>
        <section class="example">
            <section class="example-input">
                <p><code>I'm just realizing that you seem to have taken my "people produce art" bit as a *description* of our reality rather than part of my hypothetical scenario as I intended it.</code></p>

        </section>
        <p>You can hide text:</p>
