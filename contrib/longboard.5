.SH NAME
longboard \- imageboard engine
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/longboard/config.yaml
.SH DESCRIPTION
The file \fBconfig.yaml\fR contains configuration options for longboard.
The following options are recognized:
.TP
.B site_name
The site name. This is displayed on the home page.
.TP
.B favicon
The favicon that will be served at /favicon.png. This file should always
be a PNG.
.TP
.B address
The address to bind to.
.TP
.B port
The port to bind to.
.TP
.B log_file
The log file to use.
.TP
.B database_uri
The database URI to use. This should start with "postgres://" and contains
information like the username, password, database hostname, and database name.
.TP
.B resource_dir
Where resources (templates, css, javascript, ...) are stored.
.TP
.B upload_dir
Where user-uploaded files are stored.
.TP
.B pages_dir
Where additional pages are stored. If set, this should be a directory of
markdown files. Any file you add to this directory will be rendered as HTML and
added to your site. All of the pages from this directory are shown in the
footer at the bottom of the page.
.IP
Typical uses for this option may include a rules page, FAQ page, donation page,
etcetera.
.IP
The page named \fBhome.md\fR is special and will be displayed on the home page,
if it exists.
.TP
.B names
The name list. This should be a plain text file with one name on each line. If
this option is set, when a user creates a post without a name, one is chosen
randomly from this file for them.
.TP
.B notice
The site notice. This file should be a markdown file. If this option is set,
the contents of this file are rendered into HTML and displayed at the top of
every board/thread page.
.TP
.B allow_uploads
Allow users to upload files.
.TP
.B allow_file_types
The list of allowed file types for uploads. Right now, longboard only supports
image and video thumbnailing, so e.g. audio files or pdf uploads won't work.
.TP
.B file_size_limit
The maximum file size for user-uploaded files. This value can be a size in
bytes, or a size with a suffix. The suffix can be K for kibibytes, M for
mebibytes, or G for gibibytes.
.TP
.B rate_limit_same_user
How long to rate limit posts with the same IP address. When this option is more
than 0, a user won't be able to make a post if they've already made a post in
the rate limit duration. For example, if the rate limit is 10 seconds, a user
will only be able to create a post every 10 seconds.
.IP
This option accepts a duration suffixed with S, M, H, or D for seconds,
minutes, hours, or days.
.TP
.B rate_limit_same_content
Like \fBrate_limit_same_user\fR but instead of rate limiting based on the IP
address, rate limit based on the post contents. Only checks the contents of the
post body.
.TP
.B filter_rules
A list of filter rules to filter posts with. Each item in this list should have
two fields:
.IP
.B pattern
The pattern to match a user's posts with. See
https://docs.rs/regex/1.3.4/regex/#syntax for valid regex sytax that can be
used.
.IP
.B replace_with
What to replace the matched text with. This is a fixed string.
.TP
.B styles
A list of style sheets that the user can choose between. If you add STYLE to
this list, then resource_dir/styles/STYLE.css should exist.
.TP
.B allow_list
A list of IP addresses to allow for posting. This list overrides both
\fBblock_list\fR and \fBdns_block_list\fR. Useful for troubleshooting.
.TP
.B block_list
A list of IP addresses to block from posting. This list is only checked when users create an anonymous resource like a thread, post, or post report. It is NOT checked for viewing boards or threads or for staff actions.
.TP
.B dns_block_list
A list of DNS block lists to use. Each item should be a DNS zone, like
rbl.efnetbl.org, and it will be queried like 1.2.3.4.rbl.efnetbl.org to check
if an IP is in the blocklist.
.IP
There are many DNSBLs across the internet for various purposes; most of them
for stopping e-mail spam. The default config comes with a few sensible ones
that you might want to use. Make sure that you are allowed to use any DNSBL you
add to this list.
.IP
Like \fBblock_list\fR, these lists are only checked when a user is creating an
anonymous resource, like a thread, post, or post report.
.TP
.B threads_per_page
How many threads will be displayed per page.
.TP
.B preview_limit
In a board listing, this option sets how many posts will be displayed per
thread.
.TP
.B num_recent_files
How many recent files will be showed on the home page.
.TP
.B num_recent_posts
How many recent posts will be displayed on the home page.
.TP
.B thread_limit
The maximum number of threads per board. When a thread is made which pushes the
total number of threads above this amount, the least recently bumped threads
are trimmed.
.SH EXTENSIONS
In addition to the configuration options listed above, longboard also supports
adding profiles to enable using different configurations for different classes
of users. These configuration profiles are called "extensions".
.PP
To create a new extension, create a new YAML file in the configuration
directory with the name of your extension. You can include the following
options in this file:
.IP \[bu] 3
pages_dir
.IP \[bu]
names_path
.IP \[bu]
notice_path
.IP \[bu]
allow_uploads
.IP \[bu]
allow_file_types
.IP \[bu]
file_size_limit
.IP \[bu]
rate_limit_same_ip
.IP \[bu]
rate_limit_same_content
.IP \[bu]
filter_rules
.IP \[bu]
custom_styles
.IP \[bu]
allow_list
.IP \[bu]
block_list
.IP \[bu]
dns_block_list
.PP
These options are equivalent to the options for the global configuration.
.PP
These options, if set, will overwrite the options in the global configuration
when this extension is being applied. Any options not set will default to the
options you set in the global configuration.
.PP
Longboard will use these extensions if the HTTP header
\fBX-LONGBOARD-EXTENSION\fR is set. The value of this header is the extension
name. For example, if the header is set to "\fITor\fR", longboard will load
additional options from \fI/etc/longboard/tor.yaml\fR. You can set this header
using a reverse proxy like nginx.
